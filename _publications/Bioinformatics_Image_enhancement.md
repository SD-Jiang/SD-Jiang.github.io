excerpt: 'We developed a pipeline to enhance the neurite signal and to suppress the background, with the goal of high SBC and better within- and between-image homogeneity. The performance of the image enhancement was quantitatively verified according to the different figures of merit benchmarking the image quality. In addition, the method could improve the neuron reconstruction in approximately 1/3 of the cases, with very few cases of degrading the reconstruction. This significantly outperformed three other approaches of image enhancement.'

## Abstract:

### Motivation
To digitally reconstruct the 3D neuron morphologies has long been a major bottleneck in neuroscience. One of the obstacles to automate the procedure is the low signal-background contrast (SBC) and the large dynamic range of signal and background both within and across images.

### Results
We developed a pipeline to enhance the neurite signal and to suppress the background, with the goal of high SBC and better within- and between-image homogeneity. The performance of the image enhancement was quantitatively verified according to the different figures of merit benchmarking the image quality. In addition, the method could improve the neuron reconstruction in approximately 1/3 of the cases, with very few cases of degrading the reconstruction. This significantly outperformed three other approaches of image enhancement. Moreover, the compression rate was increased five times by average comparing the enhanced to the raw image. All results demonstrated the potential of the proposed method in leveraging the neuroscience by providing better 3D morphological reconstruction and lower cost of data storage and transfer.
