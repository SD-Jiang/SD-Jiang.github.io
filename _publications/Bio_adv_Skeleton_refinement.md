excerpt: 'Digital tracing or reconstruction of a neural morphology is defined to geometrically model the backbone of neurites with countable topologically connected structure components like 3D spheres or lines segments, and stores the coordinate, thickness and graph connectivity information in SWC file. Here, we introduce a Neuron Reconstruction Refinement Strategy (NRRS) to address the deviation issues in neuron tracing.'

## Abstract:

It is crucial to develop accurate and reliable algorithms for fine reconstruction of neural morphology from whole-brain image datasets. Even though the involvement of human experts in the reconstruction process can help to ensure the quality and accuracy of the reconstructions, automated refinement algorithms are necessary to handle substantial deviations problems of reconstructed branches and bifurcation points from the large-scale and high-dimensional nature of the image data. Our proposed Neuron Reconstruction Refinement Strategy (NRRS) is a novel approach to address the problem of deviation errors in neuron morphology reconstruction. Our method partitions the reconstruction into fixed-size segments and resolves the deviation problems by re-tracing in two steps. We also validate the performance of our method using a synthetic dataset. Our results show that NRRS outperforms existing solutions and can handle most deviation errors. We apply our method to SEU-ALLEN/BICCN dataset containing 1741 complete neuron reconstructions and achieve remarkable improvements in the accuracy of the neuron skeleton representation, the task of radius estimation and axonal bouton detection. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of NRRS in refining neuron morphology reconstruction.
