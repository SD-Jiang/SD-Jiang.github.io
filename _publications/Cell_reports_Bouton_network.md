excerpt: 'We examined the distribution of pre-synaptic contacts in axons of mouse neurons and constructed wholebrain single-cell neuronal networks using an extensive dataset of 1,891 fully reconstructed neurons. We found that bouton locations were not homogeneous throughout the axon and among brain regions. As our algorithm was able to generate whole-brain single-cell connectivity matrices from full morphology reconstruction datasets, we further found that non-homogeneous bouton locations have a significant impact on network wiring, including degree distribution, triad census, and community structure. By perturbing neuronal morphology, we further explored the link between anatomical details and network topology. In our in silico exploration, we found that dendritic and axonal tree span would have the greatest impact on network wiring, followed by synaptic contact deletion. Our results suggest that neuroanatomical details must be carefully addressed in studies of whole-brain networks at the single-cell level.'

### Results

We hypothesize that neuron morphology details determine network wiring. Specifically, we consider that distribution of axonal boutons throughout the axonal tree is not uniform and that such distribution determines network topology. Meanwhile, perturbation of specific morphological properties (i.e., neuron tree size, complexity, and density of axonal boutons) has a differential significant impact on network structure. To test this hypothesis, we devised an algorithm to generate single-cell networks in the whole brain using putative bouton locations and also simulated uniformly distributed boutons throughout the axon. First, we illustrate the biological relevance of axonal bouton distributions. With the networks we generated, we perform a detailed graph-theoretical analysis of the network
structure and its dependence on axonal bouton distribution. To contextualize this information and explore its relevance in comparison to biologically plausible neural morphological alterations, we explored the impact of perturbing specific morphological features.
