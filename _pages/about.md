I am currently a Ph.D. student in [Institute for Brain and Intelligence](https://braintell.org/) of Southeast University, under the supervision of [Prof. Hanchuan Peng](https://home.penglab.com/). I received my M.S. degree from Southeast University in 2019.

My research interests lie in Big data management. Currently, I am working on updating the index of large-scale bioimaging data.
